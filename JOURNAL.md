## 10/5/2025 - Planning Phase  

![IMG_0373.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQ3LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ce71cb4cd23e579b96b823e82d1cd997f1018f76/IMG_0373.jpeg)
Worked on planning out the plastic extrusion project. Looking to use as many off-the-shelf parts as possible (so cost isn’t extremely expensive).
Scoping out BOM. Took a look at potential parts.
This is the boring phase of projects because there isn’t really anything to show.  

## 10/20/2025 - The best way isn't the most elegant, but the way that works

Currently, I'm still researching and scoping out parts and how things will generally work together. After a very long headache and tons of hair pulling, it finally occurred to me that I was overthinking the problem. Essentially, I would need to fix heating elements to the plastic extruder's barrel, which is commonly achieved using band-heaters. Unfortunately, those don't come in sizes I need, and they run on 220V. I was planning on mainly using a 3D printer's electronics for this project, so a heater cartridge was my way to go. And how do you mount a heater cartridge onto a circular object? I didn't have any metal clamps, and I didn't want to have to machine a custom part, so I felt lost. Then I realized I could simply use high-temp aluminum tape to fix the heater cartridges onto the metal barrel.
