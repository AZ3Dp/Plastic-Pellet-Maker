## 10/5/2025 - Planning Phase  

![IMG_0373.jpeg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjQ3LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--ce71cb4cd23e579b96b823e82d1cd997f1018f76/IMG_0373.jpeg)
Worked on planning out the plastic extrusion project. Looking to use as many off-the-shelf parts as possible (so cost isn’t extremely expensive).
Scoping out BOM. Took a look at potential parts.
This is the boring phase of projects because there isn’t really anything to show.
